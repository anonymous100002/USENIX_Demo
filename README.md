# File System Access API Demo for USENIX Submission - Winter 2023


This demo has been developed to address reviewer feedback for our USENIX submission. The purpose of this demo is to demonstrate how the write permission dialog works when using the File System Access API. The application allows the user to modify the content of all .txt files in the directory with a single write permission dialog.

We hope that this demo provides a clear and practical example and clarifies the our reviewers' comments. 

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need a local web server like `http-server` or `live-server`. Alternatively, you can use the "Live Server" extension in Visual Studio Code.

If you don't have `http-server` installed, you can install it globally via npm:

```sh
npm install -g http-server
```
## Running the Project

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/anonymous100002/demo_project_fsa.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```sh
cd demo_project_fsa
```
3. Serve the project using a local web server, such as http-server:

```sh
http-server
```
Alternatively, you can use the "Live Server" extension in Visual Studio Code by right-clicking the index.html file and selecting "Open with Live Server."

4. Open your web browser and navigate to the local server address, typically http://localhost:8080/main.html or http://127.0.0.1:8080/main.html.
