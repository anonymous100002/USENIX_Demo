# File System Access API Demo for USENIX Submission - Winter 2023


This demo has been developed in response to reviewer feedback for our USENIX submission. The primary purpose of the demo is to showcase the write permission dialog when using the File System Access API. The application enables users to modify the content of all `.txt` files in a selected directory using a single write permission dialog.

Our aim is to provide a clear and practical example that addresses the concerns raised by our reviewers.
